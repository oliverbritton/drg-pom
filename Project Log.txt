Findings:
Vm Peak is clustered between 50 - 55 mV, mean in Davidson is around 65 mV. 
However, surprisingly there seems to be a negative correlation between Vm Peak and GNav 1.8, with little effect by any other conductance. That is, the lowest values of GNav1.8 have the highest Vm Peak, which is weird and contradicts Choi Waxman Fig 6B.

Although, the Choi Waxman model doesn't have a high enough Vm Peak either.

One thing to check would be using different stimulus currents, and plot effect of step current size on Vm Peak.

Paper thoughts:
Mutation reasons remain unknown.
We aimed to test the effects of mutation in a human in silico model. 
Reason for modelling: determine cause

Big ideas:
Sloppiness, degeneracy, criticality, variability
