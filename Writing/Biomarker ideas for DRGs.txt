Biomarker ideas for DRG neurons

Frequency-current curve (frequency of AP firing against injected current) - slope of curve is the "gain" of the neuron

Rheobase (current to fire an AP)

Length of sustained firing

AP amplitude

AP duration (width at 50% max amplitude)

Resting potential

Frequency of sustained firing - calculated by inverse of mean inter-spike interval

Existence of sub-threshold oscillation
