Follow ups from Ratte Prescott 2016

Learn about MAPK kinases - how they regulate ion channels

Read previous work:
What approach did they use and what sort of results and conclusions did they support. What is feasible, what can I build on, and what is done and settled.

BIg picture:

Ion channel changes are part of a larger adaptive, potentially degenerate system.

Targeting one channel is unlike to be sufficient, even if the channel causes hyperexcitability, as other mechanisms may also be in place. A sort of hyper-excitability reserve, you can only knock so much of it out by hitting one component of the system.

In favour of multiple specific treatments - get advantage of the specific (less off target effects) and the advantages of multiple targets - more likely to punch through degeneracy.



Waxman 2014 Review

Nav 1.8 increased by inflammatory mediators through p38-mediated phosphorylation.

5% of patients with painful peripheral neuropathy do not have Nav 1.7 mutations.
Dysfunction of nerve fibres is length dependent - longest fibres develop neuropathy earliest.
Possible causes: 1) calcium-dependent cell injury from ...
