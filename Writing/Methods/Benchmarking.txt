11/12/2015: 5 models, 101 simulations, 1 core: 76s

76/5 ~= 15s per model 


08/02/2015

1 model, 100 simulations, nearly full suite of basic software: 52 seconds

0.5 seconds per model per simulation

Worst case scenario: ~200 simulations per model

10,000 models * 200 simulations * 0.5 seconds = 1,000,000 s

Also each simulation is 1 MB of output (0.025s time resolution).
