Choice of Nav 1.9 channel model

Models of Nav 1.9 I know about (21/01/2016)

Herzog 2001 (used in Tigerholm)
Huang 2014 (human-specific although expressed in rat)

Huang and Herzog have similar steady states, except Herzog has about 10 times smaller open probability in the resting potential range. So main difference is effective conductance. 

Huang seems like the obvious choice here, without further conductance information.
