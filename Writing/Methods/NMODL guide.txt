TITLE and COMMENT ENDCOMMENT blocks are just descriptive.

NEURON {} block is the public interface. Specific to Neuron.

SUFFIX identifies a density mechanism (that can be put in with insert). Also all names for parameters and variables for this mechanism will be appended with _SUFFIX.

RANGE asserts which variables are functions of position, so they can vary across a section. Alternative is GLOBAL.

NONSPECIFIC CURRENT and USEION are for determining which ions are moving through this mechanism.

Neuron's default value of celsium is 6.3. Maybe I should do the q10 adjustments manually in the channel models.
