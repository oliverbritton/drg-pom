Definition of the 'default' stimulus protocol

Intended to be a baseline, straightforward protocol to enable comparison with
the biomarkers in the Davidson paper without too many simulations being necessary.

Definition:

1. Quiesence test
amp = 0 for duration 1000 ms

biomarkers: RMP only

2. Step test
amp = 0 for duration 200 ms
amp = 0,3500,50 for duration 800 ms
amp = 0 for duration 200 ms

biomarkers: 
split trace (num APs)
StepRheobase (to define rheobase)

3. Biomarker calculation on rheobase trace
On rheobase trace calculate the main set of biomarkers
biomarkers:
Threshold 
APPeak
APRise
APSlopeMax
APSlopeMin 
APWidth
AHPAmp 
AHPTau

3. Ramp test???
