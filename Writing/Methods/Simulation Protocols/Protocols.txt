Simulation Protocols for Stage 1 DRG Project

Aims:
1) Recreate stimulus protocols from Davidson et al. to allow consistency and comparison with their biomarkers

2) Develop any new simulations that might be required to ensure the model behaves consistently with reality (e.g. no automaticity)

Therefore:

Need a list of biomarkers and behaviours that a DRG model should be consistent with to be acceptable. (DRG Model Requirements.txt)

This file will provide a list of simulation protocols to allow a model to be tested to see whether it fulfils the existing requirements list.

--- Aim 1 - Stimulus protocols from Davidson et al. ---

Ramp protocol
	Ramp for 500 ms. Start at 50 pA, increasing by 50 pA at each peak until reached defined maximum (3500 pA?) or first AP detected.

Step protocol
	Step for 800 ms. Start at 50 pA, increase by 50 pA until cells reach threshold or reach 3500 pA.

--- Aim 2 - Simulations to be compliant with model requirements ---

1. Quiecence test
	Simulate for an order of magnitude (1,10,100,1000?) seconds.
	Requirement 1 is passed if no APs are detected.
	Requirement 2 is passed if Vm is stable after the first (10%?) of simulation. Stable would mean dV/dt < epsilon for the last (90%?) of simulation.
	
2. No infinite firing test
	Simulate a very large stimulus that stops.
	Requirement 3 is passed if a certain period (1s?) at the end of the simulation has no APs and a stable RMP.
	
3. Above threshold test.
	Simulate above ramp and step thresholds to see what happens - stimulus dependent behaviour.
