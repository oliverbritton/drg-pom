Simulations needed to recreate Davidson:

Input resistance protocol:
Hyperpolarising current injection of 50 to 100 pA. (So opposite to a normal stimulus!)

Ramp protocol
500 ms ramp, increase by 50 or 100 pA per sweep until cells reached threshold.

Step protocol
Step current injections. 800 ms duration. Increased by 50 or 100 pA per sweep until cells reached threshold.
What was maximum current used?

Rheobase mean was 1440 pA. SEM = 110 pA n = 110 so STD ~= 1100 pA so mean + 2 STD ~ 3500 pA. 
Therefore looking at 40-80 simulations for each protocol.


Intersweep interval - 3 to 5 s.

Most neurons only evoked a single AP, but stimulus was only tested until an AP fired.
