Use a paper research database in pandas.

One dataframe contains every paper I've read to build the model
with date and a unique ID.

Then another dataframe hoovers up notes from either txt, csv, excel,
sqllite or exported evernote notes and creates a second dataframe where
each row is information from a paper with the paper ID and which current and 
specific property the quote relates to. 

Then I can search for everything on Nav 1.7, and specify activation gate time constant, 
gating structure, activation voltage dependence, full current formulation, etc.

Or everything on rat DRG AP.

And so on.
