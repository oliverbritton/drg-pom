IKdr is required for repolarisation and controls APD.
IKA does something weird - reducing it turns steady spike trains into 2-spike pulses with EADs with gradually lengtheg duration between them during period of stimulation.
IKM clamps to about -55 mV when increased x10, causes repolarisation failure and AP prolongation when reduced.
