Analysis plan
1/2/16

Overall aim: Have something reasonable to show to David Bennett and on its way to a small publication

[x] Make the model, limited currents

[] Simulate its behaviour over wide range of conductances - try and find models near the mean for all biomarkers:
if not too much variability in conductances between nearby models
	then interpolate around there to find a baseline and compare against other models - does it look reasonable?
	
[] Build populations using davidson biomarkers and do automated characterisation of their distributions of biomarkers - things to vary:
	biomarkers: +/- 1 or 2 std devs, or vary depending on whether std devs take you -ve (use a log normal distribution??)
	conductance variation: +/- 100%, +/- 50%, and maybe Alfonso's strategy to test it
	
[] With population 
	- run blocks - characterise automatically 
	- run mutations - characterise automatically (try and recapture phenotype)
